# CryptoniteScout
Hello fellow collaborators and cryptonians. My name is Prasann Singhal and I will be leading the creation of an android 
(and hopefully IOS)scouting app that will enable for easy, fast, offline scouting with more sophisticated data analysis that 
will actively connect with the scouting database.

Here are the assignments as per current people on the team.
Prasann Singhal-
I will be managing and creating the local database that will eventually communicate with the online one. I will also do a 
lot of the initial structuring for xml and backend code.

Lucas Cai - 
I want you to work on the DataEntryActivity xml and the implementation methods for the fragment.
It will all be set up hopefully by the time you get on it.

Taemin - 
You're new to Android so I'll start you with some stuff to get you comfortable with xml.
I want you to remodel the xml of the fragments, and create the onclicklistener code for each
button. Ill try to Skpe you on Tuesday or Thursday of Thanksgiving break.
For now just do the xml, look at the code already done, get a feel for it, and make it look and 
work ok. Ask away on text.

*******************************************************************************************************************************

I ALSO WANT TO ESTABLISH SOME GROUND RULES FOR GITHUB. MASTER WILL BE THE FINAL, FUNCTIONAL BRANCH WHICH I WILL UPDATE BASED ON 
YOUR CODE WHICH YOU WILL TELL ME WHEN IT IS READY. MAKE SURE THAT YOU STAY UP TO DATE ON THE MASTER AND DONT LET ANY OF YOUR 
CODE GET BEHIND. IT MAKES MY LIFE A LOT HARDER, AND YOU LOSE A LOT OF LEARNING.

NEVER EVER PUSH STRAIGHT TO MASTER, KEEP YOUR OWN BRANCH, NAMED AFTER YOU
