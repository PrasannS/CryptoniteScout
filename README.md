# CryptoniteScout
Hello fellow collaborators and cryptonians. My name is Prasann Singhal and I will be leading the creation of an android 
(and hopefully IOS)scouting app that will enable for easy, fast, offline scouting with more sophisticated data analysis that 
will actively connect with the scouting database.

*******************************************************************************************************************************

I ALSO WANT TO ESTABLISH SOME GROUND RULES FOR GITHUB. MASTER WILL BE THE FINAL, FUNCTIONAL BRANCH WHICH I WILL UPDATE BASED ON 
YOUR CODE WHICH YOU WILL TELL ME WHEN IT IS READY. MAKE SURE THAT YOU STAY UP TO DATE ON THE MASTER AND DONT LET ANY OF YOUR 
CODE GET BEHIND. IT MAKES MY LIFE A LOT HARDER, AND YOU LOSE A LOT OF LEARNING.

NEVER EVER PUSH STRAIGHT TO MASTER, KEEP YOUR OWN BRANCH, NAMED AFTER YOU
